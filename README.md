# Clock-With-Alarm-OLED
 Clock using NTP Library with an alarm feature. (Note: NTP Library imported from Github (version 3.2.0 on Arduino IDE))

## Description
 This project uses ESP32, OLED, an active buzzer, and a 4x4 matrix membrane keypad. It is able to tell the time, date, and set an alarm (with memory through EEPROM).
 All of the code is in one file (it's a mess to read) because my lecturer said so. :/
